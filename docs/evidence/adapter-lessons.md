# What the adapters had to be corrected for

Corrections the adapters were forced into: charges, settlement, and the traps
that produced a plausible wrong number rather than an error.

## Two corrections to the original plan

**Polymarket is far better structured than assumed.** The plan expected
"prose-titled binaries" needing a confidence-scored decomposer, and recorded that
standardised game totals largely do not exist. Neither is true of the Gamma API
as it stands: an event carries `teams` with an explicit `ordering: home|away`, a
`startTime`, and markets carrying `sportsMarketType` (`moneyline`, `spreads`,
`totals`) with a numeric `line`. Totals exist at 7.5, 8.5 and 9.5 on the MLB
slate. So the mapping is from structured fields only, exactly as required, and no
title is ever parsed.

**`settlement_shape_mismatch` was never all-or-nothing.** The plan lists it
alongside `source_prices_itself_to_lose` as a refusal that discards the whole
group. Reading the code, it records a diagnostic and then carries on per contract
shape; only `source_prices_itself_to_lose`, `mixed_sport` and
`legs_disagree_on_the_game` actually abandoned the group, and those are what were
fixed.

## Notes on charges

Getting a commission rate wrong in the *generous* direction manufactures
arbitrage; getting it wrong in the strict direction only loses one. Every
uncertainty below is resolved in the second direction on purpose.

- **Matchbook, Smarkets** — 2% of net winnings, the published standard rate. An
  account can earn a lower one through volume, so using the standard rate
  understates the edge rather than inventing one.
- **SX Bet** — its own `/metadata` reports `oracleFees` of `5 × 10^18` against a
  `10^20` scale. That reading is not stated in words anywhere in the payload, so
  it is taken as **5% of net winnings**, the most expensive plausible
  interpretation.
- **Kalshi** — the published schedule, `0.07 × p × (1−p)` per contract, charged on
  entry.
- **Polymarket** — read from the market payload's own
  `feeSchedule: {rate: 0.05, exponent: 1, takerOnly: true}`, which is
  `0.05 × min(p, 1−p)` per contract.

A charge on entry is not a rate on winnings with some equivalent number: it is
due whether or not the contract settles your way. Both shapes are modelled
separately in `src/commission.py`.

## Notes on settlement

A commission changes how much a leg pays. What a venue does with a game that is
never played decides whether the leg is part of a hedge at all, and the venues
here do three different things. Quoted from the captured payloads:

- **Sportsbooks and the exchanges** — void a cancelled or long-postponed fixture
  and return the stake. Matchbook, Smarkets and SX Bet are in this regime with
  the books: their markets void with the underlying event.
- **Kalshi** — `rules_secondary`, on every one of the 354 captured markets: *"If
  this game is postponed or delayed, the market will remain open and close after
  the rescheduled game has finished (within two days). If the game is cancelled
  or rescheduled to over two days away, the market will resolve to a fair price
  in accordance with the rules."*
- **Polymarket** — market `description`: *"If the game is postponed, this market
  will remain open until the game has been completed. If the game is canceled
  entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50."*

So a book leg against a Kalshi leg on a rained-out game leaves the book refunding
while Kalshi settles from the make-up game — a naked one-sided bet for the whole
Kalshi stake, on a position that was reported as risk-free. Against Polymarket, a
contract bought at 0.75 returns 0.50 while the book returns everything.

`src/settlement.py` records the regime per source and the registry refuses a
source that declares none, exactly as it does for commission. The rules are not
*modelled* — each venue reserves discretion the payloads do not pin down, and a
caveat that overstated its own precision would be worse than one that says
plainly what is unknown. What is modelled is the only thing the engine needs:
which venues void together. Every position spanning two regimes carries the
note.

## Traps the adapters had to be corrected for

Recorded because each was found only by reading a venue's bytes against another
venue's, and every one of them was silent — valid rows, healthy sources, no
finding of any kind.

- **Bovada writes an Asian split line as two fields.** `price.handicap` and
  `price.handicap2` are the two halves the stake divides between, always exactly
  half a point apart (54 of 54 in the fixtures, 114 of 114 live). The line is
  their midpoint. Reading only the first published a −0.25 handicap as a
  draw-no-bet, which is a different contract, not a near-miss: **41 of 43
  reported positions on a live slate were built on a mis-stated line**, and
  reading the pair correctly took that run from 43 opportunities to 2.

- **Kalshi does not publish `no_ask_size_fp`.** It appears in none of the 354
  captured markets, so 255 of 590 rows carried no bankroll cap and were sized
  entirely from the other leg. Buying NO at its ask is selling YES at its bid —
  `no_ask == 1 - yes_bid` holds exactly on all 354 — so the depth is the YES bid
  size. One of the caps that reappeared is $0.12.

- **Matchbook's `odds` means whatever `odds-type` says.** Both fields are on all
  17,057 captured prices and agree, because the type is `DECIMAL` on every one.
  The dangerous direction is AMERICAN: a true decimal 4.00 arrives as `+300` and
  would be recorded as decimal 300.0 — an implied probability of 0.33%, inside
  the plausibility band, on every underdog. The adapter reads `decimal-odds`,
  which is unconditional.

- **SX Bet's `type` is not a global vocabulary.** Type 52 is the match winner in
  tennis and a draw-loses two-way in soccer. One flat table held only the
  US-sport codes, so the whole soccer and tennis book was fetched and discarded
  while the source declared eighteen leagues and delivered three. The table is
  keyed by `(sport, type)`, which made it safe to add tennis and correct to leave
  soccer out until someone maps it deliberately.

- **Pinnacle's `isLive` is a product flag, not a clock.** It says whether a
  matchup has moved to the in-play book, which is not whether the game has begun:
  248 rows across 18 fixtures carried a start time in the past, all `isLive:
  false`, all emitted as active — including a tennis match two hours old priced
  at 1.01. Every other adapter already compared the start against the capture.

- **Pinnacle routes unrecognised soccer competitions to one catch-all league,**
  and the competition name was then read by nothing — so `Club Friendlies Women`
  Utrecht v De Graafschap produced a key byte-identical to the men's fixture. The
  marker is now taken from the competition and appended to the club, for club
  sports only: a player is the same player whatever the draw is called.

- **Kambi's betoffer responses carry no `range` field.** The truncation guard read
  `range.total` and therefore returned `None` unconditionally, which killed both
  the fetch-time batch-halving retry and the parse-time rejection. The `events`
  array is real and echoes the request exactly, so a shortfall there is the same
  signal against bytes that exist.
